OpenFABMAP [Glover et. al. 2012](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5509547&tag=1) is an open-source, OpenCV-only dependent, version of the popular Fast Appearance-based Mapping (FAB-MAP) algorithm [Cummins & Newman 2008](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5509547&tag=1 Glover et al. 2010). OpenFABMAP was developed from the ground-up following FAB-MAP publications. The original FAB-MAP algorithm is now also [open-source](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mjc/Software.htm) but requires alternative project dependencies. 



### This Reaserch is heavily based on 
#### Glover et. al. 2012,  St. Lucia Multiple Times of Day and Other Datasets Cummins & Newman 2008

By applying modification to the following files We have created our own version of the algorithm:

### Untitled.ipynb, 
### prog.cpp,
### openFABMAPcli.cpp, and
### settings.yml 

 If you find it usefull please cite it in the following form.

The following material in the https://github.com/arrenglover/openfabmap provides a complete toturial to 
run the program successfully.
